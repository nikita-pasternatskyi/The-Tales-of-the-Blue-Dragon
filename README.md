# The Tales of the Blue Dragon

This is a project that I had to make for my university bachelor studies. 
Made in Unity, most of the visual assets were taken from the Asset Store. Project was made purely for studying reasons. 

Music was done by Desmond Delaine @rasvyett

3D Model of Dark Elf Human was made by Muti Altanov

All of the programming was made by me. 

Amount of time for the project: 3 months

## Most important implemented features
### - Inventory
Player can collect, view, equip items using inventory coded purely from scratch using a Model-View approach (with the model being the actual inventory, just one, and lots of different views such as inventory slots, etc.)
### - State Machine
Player, Enemies, Boss are all operated using the same state machine pattern.
### - Cutscenes
Player has a special state upon entering which the Player will lose all the control over character, and the game will show a cutscene created using the Timeline tools built into unity.
### - FMOD Sounds Integration
Instead of using Unity's built in audio components, I opted for using FMOD, as it makes it much easier to create complex sounds.
### - Combat system
Combat system with a combo mechanic, as well dodge and roll.


## Worth noting
Final Boss Stage, Monster form model, Animations (transformation as well as all others) were created by me in Blender3D.
